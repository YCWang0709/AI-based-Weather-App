# AI-based Weather App

## Installation & Setup
Prerequisites : 
- **Node.js**
- **MongoDB** : locally installed or use MongoDB Atlas;
- **API keys** : already in `.env` list;

**Clone Respository**
```shell

```

**Backend Setup**
```shell
cd backend
npm install
```

**Frontend Setup**
```shell
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Run**

npm start
```
## Overview
This project is a **full-stack weather application** that allows users to search for weather infomation using `GPS coordinates`, `city names`. The app provides:

- **Current Weather** : real-time data from OpenWeather API;

- **Past 3 Days Weather** : Historical weather data from Open-Meteo API;

- **Future 2 Days Forecast** : short-term forecast from OpenWeather API;

- **User Authentication** : login, register and delete account;

- **Weather Query History** : user can view, search, update, add and delete past searches;

- **Data Export Functionality** : export weather query history in `.csv`, `.json` and `.pdf` formats;

- **AI Insight** : travel suggestions based on weather data and location provided by `DeepSeek-v1`;

## Project structure
The application consists of two main parts:

- **Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)** : 
    - handle user authentication (login / register / delete);
    - fetches and stores weather data in `MongoDB`;
    - provides endpoints for querying and managing weather history;
    - uses external APIs for weather data and AI insights;
    - supports exporting weather data in `.csv`, `.json` and `.pdf` formats;

- **Frontend (React.js)** : 
    - allows users to search weather using coordinates, city names and GPS;
        - search by **GPS location** (automatically fetches location coordinates);
        - search by **City name** (converts city to latitude & longitude via `OpenCage API`);
    - displays current, past and future weather in a structured table;
    - enables users to manage all users' history (CRUD operations);
    - fetches AI-generated weather insights using `DeepSeek v1`;
    - provides travel recommendations using `DeepSeek v1`;
    - allows exporting weather data in multiple formats;

## Future Improvements
- Using `ZIP` for searching weather. But whatever used, we can convert them into coordinates;
- Add 5-days forecast (Sorry for that, but `OpenWeather` free plan just supports two-day forecast);
- For past three days' weather, what we used is `OpenCage API`, but this API don't contain `wind speed` and `humidity`. And they use weather code represent weather, need to find the mapping file;
- Improved UI;
